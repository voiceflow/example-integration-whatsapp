* * *

## Before you begin
This guide is intended for people building an integration for their own organizations. If you are building an integration that will be used by another business, see Meta's [Get Started for Solution Partners doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started-for-solution-partners) or their [Get Started for Tech Providers doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/get-started-for-tech-providers).


# Create an app on Facebook Developers portal

Follow the Get started guide here to create your app and get your WhatsApp token.

<br>

Select "**Business**" for app type ![business app](/doc/business-app.png) and click **Next**
<br>

Fill the **needed info** for the app creation ![app info](/doc/app-info.png) and click **Create app**
<br>

On the next page, scroll down to the WhatsApp integration

<br><br>

Create a Business account (or select an existing one)

You can add your phone number by clicking on Manage phone number list
<br>

Now that you are ready to do a test, simply click on the **Send message** button.
![send message](/doc/curl-message.png)<br>

You should get something like this in your **WhatsApp** app
![test message](/doc/test-message.png)<br>

# Webhook
## Using Replit

Fork the following Replit project: https://replit.com/@niko-voiceflow/example-integration-whatsapp?v=1

Open the Secret tool, click on Edit as JSON and copy/paste the following JSON code<br>
![test message](/doc/replit_secret.png)<br><br>

Optional: To support audio messages you will need to use an API key available on PicoVoice Dev console
https://console.picovoice.ai/


```
{
  "PICOVOICE_API_KEY": "",
  "WHATSAPP_VERSION": "v17.0",
  "WHATSAPP_TOKEN": "",
  "VERIFY_TOKEN": "voiceflow",
  "VF_API_KEY": "",
  "VF_PROJECT_ID": "",
  "VF_VERSION_ID": "development",
  "VF_DM_URL": "https://general-runtime.voiceflow.com",
  "VF_TRANSCRIPT_ICON": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.voiceflow.studio/share/200x200/200x200.png",
  "PORT": 3000
}
```

Update the keys accordingly with the values you got from the previous steps.<br>

You can find your **Dialog API key (VF_API_KEY)** in the **integration** tab in Creator and the **project ID (VF_PROJECT_ID)** in the **project settings** (this is needed if you want to save transcripts).<br>

For the **VF_VERSION_ID**, you can use 'development', 'production' or a specific version ID (from the **project settings**).<br>

Once done, click on **Run** and you should see something like this:
![run](/doc/replit_run.png)<br>

From the webview tab, you want to copy the URL.

##### WhatsApp Webhook
Back on our **Getting Started** Facebook Developer page, click on the **Configure webhooks** link
![step 3](/doc/step-3.png)<br>

On this new page, click on **Edit**<br>
![edit webhook](/doc/edit-webhook.png)<br><br>

This is where you will need to set your **webhook's callback URL** and your **Verify token**<br>
![edit webhook 2](/doc/edit-webhook-2.png)<br><br>

Do not forget to add **/webhook** at the end of the URL and the **verify token** you set in the **Replit secrets**.<br>
When ready, click on **Verify and Save**.
![webhook](/doc/wa_replit_webhook.png)<br>

On your Replit console, you should see this message:
```WEBHOOK_VERIFIED```<br>

Last step, we want to choose what to receive, and to do so, we need to subscribe to the message event.<br><br>

Click on **Manage** and, on the new window, **subscribe** to **messages**
![manage](/doc/manage.png)<br><br>

You should have a config similar to this one

![sub-messages](/doc/wa_messages.png)<br><br>


## Using ngrok (local)

##### Prepare your dev environement
Clone this repo

```git clone https://github.com/voiceflow/example-integration-whatsapp.git```

In the example-integration-whatsapp, do a:

```npm i```

Install ngrok, more details here: https://ngrok.com/download<br>

Before going further, let's start populating our .env file with our token.
In the root of the app directory, rename the **.env.example** file to **.env**<br>
We are going to populate this file with the needed info for the WhatsApp webhook as well as the Voiceflow project.

Optional: To support audio messages you will need to use an API key available on PicoVoice Dev console
https://console.picovoice.ai/


```
{
  "PICOVOICE_API_KEY": "",
  "WHATSAPP_VERSION": "v17.0",
  "WHATSAPP_TOKEN": "",
  "VERIFY_TOKEN": "voiceflow",
  "VF_API_KEY": "",
  "VF_PROJECT_ID": "",
  "VF_VERSION_ID": "development",
  "VF_DM_URL": "https://general-runtime.voiceflow.com",
  "VF_TRANSCRIPT_ICON": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/com.voiceflow.studio/share/200x200/200x200.png",
  "PORT": 3000
}
```

For now, you can paste the token for the **WHATSAPP_TOKEN** variable,
you can use anything for the **VERIFY_TOKEN** or leave it to 'voiceflow'.

Regarding the port, you can put the value you want, by default the app will use **3000**

You can find your **Dialog API key (VF_API_KEY)** in the **integration** tab in Creator and the **project ID (VF_PROJECT_ID)** in the **project settings** (this is needed if you want to save transcripts).<br>

For the **VF_VERSION_ID**, you can use 'development', 'production' or a specific version ID (from the **project settings**).<br><br>


##### WhatsApp Webhook
Back on our **Getting Started** Facebook Developer page, click on the **Configure Webhook** link<br>
![step 3](/doc/step-3.png)<br><br>

On this new page, click on **Edit**<br>
![edit webhook](/doc/edit-webhook.png)<br><br>

This is where you will need to set your **webhook's callback URL** and your **Verify token**<br>
![edit webhook 2](/doc/edit-webhook-2.png)<br><br>

For the **Verify token**, put what you've set in your **.env** file (**voiceflow** by default)<br>

For the Callback URL to be accessible, we will need to start the app.

From the root of the directory, start the app with

```npm start```

And if everything work as expected, you should have something similar to this<br><br>
![app start](/doc/app-start.png)<br><br>

We are listening, let's use ngrok to open this to the world.

In a new terminal, type

```ngrok http 3000```

Replace **3000** with the **PORT** number you choose to use.
<br><br>
![ngrok console](/doc/ngrok-console.png)<br>
Here, the URL you want to copy is the secure one (starting with https)
Almost there, go back to your **Config page**, paste this URL and add the **/webhook** path to it.<br>
![webhook url](/doc/webhook-url.png)<br><br>

And click on **Verify and save**
If everything is fine, the previous window should close and your webhook ready.
<br>
![webhook setup](/doc/webhook-setup.png)<br><br>

On your terminal, you should see this message:
```WEBHOOK_VERIFIED```<br><br>

Last step, we want to choose what to receive, and to do so, we need to subscribe to the message event.<br><br>

Click on **Manage** and, on the new window, **subscribe** to **messages**
![manage](/doc/manage.png)<br><br>

You should have a config similar to this one

![sub-messages](/doc/wa_messages.png)<br><br>
